This project is a work in progress.  It's goal is to copy an HDMI input signal
to memory, allow the CPU to modify it, and then read that out from memory.

At present, it only copies an HDMI input signal to the output--after going
through a decoder.

UPDATE: 20190211 -- the ethernet now receives packets
